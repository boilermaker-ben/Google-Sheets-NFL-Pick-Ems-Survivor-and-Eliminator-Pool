# Google Sheets / Forms NFL Pick'Ems and Survivor Pool 
## Creation and Management Tool for Running your Own Group

Google Sheet document with multiple script files to generate Google Forms for season-long NFL Pick'Ems or Survivor league management

-------------------------

**TLDR: Go [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cafdoM2H5JDXqDxH58Unww7TAFRHr_kWZN5IdDN2-eY/edit?usp=sharing) and make a copy of the sheet. Follow prompts. Enjoy!**

-------------------------


**Welcome!** The project below was developed over four seasons of NFL play (maybe NCAAF eventually) to create a new way of managing an NFL pick ‚Äôems, survivor, or eliminator pool. Copying the file will enable you to customize and generate a series of sheets in your copy of the spreadsheet for tracking all picks through the 18 regular season games of an NFL season and may work through the playoffs. It also includes a Monday Night Football most correct season-long winner, a weekly most correct winner, and a season-long most correct winner. The tool will also create a weekly Google Form (questionnaire) that is used to collect responses from members that can be imported to the spreadsheet easily. Match results and tiebreaker scores can also be pulled in via scripts in the 'Picks' menu. The final Monday Night Football game score total each week is used as the tiebreaker for the pick ‚Äòems weekly competition (some weeks we do have 2 MNF games). Tiebreakers, comments, exclusion of Thursday games, and more can be disabled/enabled via the setup.

It‚Äôs up to the person running the league to import the picks for the week (ideally before Thursday night) and also to update the form for the coming week (usually done Tuesday or Wednesday morning to send to the members).

I was keen to help a friend create a more robust way to track a family and friends league three seasons ago and the effort resulted in this massive and complex block of thousands of lines of code. I‚Äôm not a coder by training, I‚Äôm an industrial designer and product manager. I hope it doesn‚Äôt break for you--but let me know if it does! If you‚Äôre inclined and have enjoyed the script and care to support my wife, my five kiddos (sixth on the way!), and me, you can [buy me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/benpowers)--no pressure though, I‚Äôm just excited that you‚Äôre using this tool!


**Disclaimer:** This set of functions relies on the use of the ESPN API for pulling NFL game data. You can find the ESPN terms of use [here](https://disneytermsofuse.com/). I‚Äôm sharing these scripts with you with the intent that you are taking on the responsibilities of the terms of use for your own personal use and don‚Äôt condone or endorse your use of the code here for monetization of ‚Äúapps‚Äù or any other content. The terms outline the need for an ‚ÄúInformation Form‚Äù to be submitted by a parent or guardian if you are a minor. This content is not intended to be published nor executed outside of the use by personal users. 

Lastly, there are some safeguards Google has in place to avoid allowing users to execute any malicious code from the Google Scripts console. Please feel free to review the code, as it contains no functions to share information, transfer information, or send emails. Information only travels between your personal Google Sheet and your Google Form (copied from a template form) that are created in the process outlined below. All sharing of content must be done by you directly (via the links that are created), such as sharing the link to the Google Form with your members and sharing a ‚Äúview only‚Äù version of the spreadsheet with them to allow the members to see their league‚Äôs standings.

# **2. Example Form (needs updated to 2025 version)**
Update your form to look like this, or whatever you prefer. The script will create all the weekly entries for each matchup of the week, a survivor pool prompt, a tiebreaker entry field, and a comments section. When membership is unlocked, the form will have a text entry field, rather than the dropdown, for ‚ÄúName‚Äù.

8. You should be able to now **re-run the "Initialize"** function. Once this is done, you can start by creating a "Configuration" via the menu, then further options should follow.

4. **use the "Picks" > "Forms" > "Form Builder" function to create your first week form.**

5. Most functions are self-explanatory, but please go to the **"Extensions" > "Apps Script" > "picks.gs"** where there are some other descriptions at the top


-------------------------

1. Weekly usage:
 - **Share the Form** with your group
 - **Import picks** (going to "Picks" > "Forms" > "Form Import" via the menu will allow you to review provided submissions and import if desired (ideally done before the Thursday night game, if present).
 - Through the weekend, as games are completed you should be able to run the "Picks" > "Utilities" > "Fetch Scores" function and **import game outcomes** via that method
 - Survivor/Eliminator Only: Alternatively, enter the game outcomes manually on the "NFL_OUTCOMES" sheet
 - Pick ‚ÄòEms: Alternatively, enter the game outcomes manually across the bottom of the correct weekly sheet. Note: If using a tiebreaker (sum of the last MNF game score), be sure to enter it in the cell to the right of the final match column or the weekly winner won‚Äôt be declared!
 - Upon completing the week (usually after the MNF game), you can **run the ‚ÄúForm Builder‚Äù function again** and start the process over again for the next week
 - **Repeat**

-------------------------

Hopeful improvements for future versions:

- Google User confirmation (auto-detection for submissions, tied to email and therefore unique identifier for members)
- Reorganize member names alphabetically as an option
- Multiple entries per user
- Option to have user removed upon submission from Form to avoid duplication
- Column for payment/entry fee received per weekly sheet
- Confidence pick 'ems capability
- Opting out of survivor competition in the Form
- NCAA Football capability
- More metrics (suggestions welcome!)

-------------------------

Thanks for checking out the project and for making it to the end!
